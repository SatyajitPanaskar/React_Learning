Pure comp
ReactJS has provided us a Pure Component. 

If we extend a class with Pure Component, there is no need for shouldComponentUpdate() Lifecycle Method. 

ReactJS Pure Component Class compares current state and props with new props and states to decide whether the React component should re-render itself or  Not.

Pure Components ensures the higher performance of the Component and ultimately makes your application faster, 

While in the case of Regular Component, it will always re-render either value of State and Props changes or not.
